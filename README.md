"The Matrix" face for Android Wear
========================================
I added font picker in this app.  
I read reviews of people who was not happy with the new font. 
so I went searched for ttf font that is very similar to the old font.  
I found it and added it and I added font picker option.   
to access the font picker option. you have to go thru android wear app and look for the matrix app
and touch to get to the font picker.
